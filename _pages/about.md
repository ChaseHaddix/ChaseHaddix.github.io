Welcome to my page! Here, I aim to do three things:
1. Tell a little about myself
2. Showcase my research projects and work experiences
3. Educate on all things neurotechnology

Use the tabs at the top to naivgate to the different pages. Please, don't hesitate to reach out through my social media on the left. Enjoy!

First off, what is neural engineering?
======
Neural engineering, subfield of biomedical engineering, seeks to to understand, repair, replace, or enhance neural systems with technological innovation. This interdisciplinary research area encompasses techniques from electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and neurosciences to improve neurological function and quality of life. 

Why would you want to work in this field? 
======
From the definition above, it becomes clear you must have a strong background in many different areas to be a successful engineer. This requires a tough courseload in college. But, if this subspecialty of biomedical engineering is for you, it can be higly rewarding. Biomedical engineering has consistently been rated among the [top jobs for growth, pay, and satisfaction](https://money.cnn.com/pf/best-jobs/2013/snapshots/1.html) and neural engineering is no exception. The combination of how much there is still to learn about the nervous system coupled with the rate of technological advancements means this burgeoning field will certainly grow for decades to come. It is an exciting prospect to be at a forefront of medical innovation and improvement of outcomes for diseases and disorders that have long been considered permanently debilitating. 

My personal story
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 



How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
