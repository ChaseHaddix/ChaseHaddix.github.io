Sometime we need to go inside the skull to figure out how the brain is behaving. While surgery is needed, the signals can be a lot clearer.


Levels of Invasiveness
------
There are multiple levels we can stick recording electrodes

Microelectrode Arrays
------
To record at the level of individual neurons, we need extremely small arrays of dozens to hundred of electrodes.

Spike Sorting
------
Now that we can record single or multi-unit activity over time, what's next?
