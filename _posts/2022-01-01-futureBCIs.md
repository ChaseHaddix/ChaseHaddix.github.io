What once seemed confined to Sci-Fi films is now a reality, to a degree...

These systems are still largely in the research and development stage, but there are some examples of real-world BCIs that are already being used or tested.

One example of a BCI is the cochlear implant, which is a device that is surgically implanted into the ear of a person who is deaf or hard of hearing. The implant uses electrodes to directly stimulate the auditory nerve, allowing the person to hear sounds that they would not be able to hear otherwise.

Another example of a BCI is the brain-controlled robotic arm. These systems use electrodes or other sensors to record electrical activity in the brain, allowing a person to control the movement of a robotic arm using only their thoughts. This technology is being developed to help people with paralysis or other movement disorders regain some of their mobility.

While BCIs are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for helping people with disabilities and other medical conditions affecting quality of life. As research in this area continues, it is likely that we will see more and more examples of real-world BCIs in the coming years.
