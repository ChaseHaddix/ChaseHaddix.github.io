You may have seen those headcaps with dozens of wires coming from them on TV or in a hospital. But what's going on? 

Electroencephalography (EEG)
------
What is it?
======
EEG is a way to measure the very tiny changes in the electric field surround your brain. Electrodes, or small pieces of conductive material such as metal, are placed on the scalp and these changes are picked up and carried down wires to be processed. To accept this, you first must understand why there is an electric field associated with your brain. Physiological processes in your body (and especially your brain) involved movement of ions from cell to cell. The best example of this is a neuron firing. Every time an action potential races down a neuron, a tiny electric field surrounds that neuron. For an incredibly thorough review of this topic, I suggest the popular book "Electric Fields of the Brain by Nunez & Srinivasan"(https://brainmaster.com/software/pubs/brain/Nunez%202ed.pdf)

Now, one little neuron can't be detect all the way out at the scalp. But what if a bunch fire at the same time. A real-world analogy: Imagine you are late to a concert or sporting event. As you walk up to the stadium, it doesn't sound very loud. But then you hear the roar of applause. Did you just miss something good? One person clapping may not be detectable, but if hundreds or thousands clap at the same time it can be noticeable. In the brain, the primary generators of EEG are known as pyramidal neurons. These neurons (when firing in unison) are detectable with EEG for a couple of reasons. First, they are located in the cortex, the outer layer of the brain. So the relatively weak electric fields don't have to travel far to reach the electrode on the scalp. Second, they are oriented perpendicular to the brain's surface. This maximizes the summation of their firings. If they were oriented randomly, their contributions may cancel each other out. These types of cells, with a pyramidal cell body owing to its name, were studied by neuroscience pioneer Santiago Ramon y Cajal. Below is a drawing of one such neuron.
