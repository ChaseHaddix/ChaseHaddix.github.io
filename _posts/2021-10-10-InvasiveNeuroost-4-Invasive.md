Sometime we need to go inside the skull to figure out how the brain is behaving. While surgery is needed, the signals we get can be very clear.


Levels of Invasiveness
------
There are multiple levels we can stick recording electrodes

Microelectrode Arrays
------
To record at the level of individual neurons, we need extremely small arrays of dozens to hundred of electrodes.
