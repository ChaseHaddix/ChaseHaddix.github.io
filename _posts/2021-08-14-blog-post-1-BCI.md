Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or alternatively called brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are systems that translate brain activity into action for some external device (think wheelchair or computer cursor). 

What's the point of a BCI?
------
  BCIs are designed to collect, process, and translate brain signals into commands for an external device. These systems of human-machine interaction offer applications in various sectors from video gaming to sleep enhancement to control of a prosthetic. The goal of all BCIs is to establish a communication pathway by detecting a specific intention from the user. They represent a direct link between your brain and the outside world. Since BCIs are not necessarily dependent on the peripheral nervous system and muscular system, an obvious application is in motor restoration and rehabilitation. A BCI capable of supplementing or replacing damaged motor pathways would greatly extend the quality of life to that individual. 


What are the different parts of a BCI?
------
  While the exact number may depend on what you read, there are really five main parts. 

Why aren't BCIs used everywhere?
------
  A number of challenges prevent BCIs from becoming commonplace in society today. The upfront cost of brain monitoring equipment such as EEG electrodes and amplifiers represent an initial hurdle. Furthermore, recording electrodes must offer high signal-to-noise ratios even outside laboratory settings. But beyond hardware developments, significant strides must be made in BCIs that are able to elicit appropriate brain modulation, extract relevant features, and obtain sufficient prediction accuracy to maintain user acceptance. 

  Usability relates to the ease of use and enjoyment a user has for a particular product. In the context of BCIs, this is especially relevant to training time. Current high-performing BCIs require extensive training with the user before intended use can begin. Such a time-consuming process is likely to deter many users who are not directly dependent on the BCI for basic communication. 

  Another issue hindering BCI development is the lack of variety in command signals. A BCI is only as versatile as its number of command signals and speed of prediction. Imagine the difficulty in moving across a room with a wheelchair that only moves a small distance in one direction every minute. BCI researchers describe such an issue as having a low information transfer rate (ITR). A term based on Shannon channel theory, ITR is a commonly used metric to access BCI performance and it depends on the number of classes, detection accuracy, and detection time. From this, an ideal BCI must be aimed at quickly and correctly detecting user intent from a multitude of options. Moving from a binary classification scheme to one in which many options are available is a method to increase the ITR.
