Implementation of fractional order filters is still a novel, but promising area in signal processing - in particular in analysis of biomedical data, such as inter alia electroencephalography (EEG), where large signal distortions may occur. One of the main challenges is the complexity of the EEG data. In this paper, potential applications of various low-pass fractional filters (Bi-fractional filtering) applied for the purpose of EEG analysis was presented. The authors tested two types (0.0013 and 0.13 order) of non-integer, low-pass filters. The promising results were compared with typical low-pass Butterworth filters.
