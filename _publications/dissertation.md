Studies have shown that marker-less motion detection systems, such as the first generation Kinect (Kinect 1), have good reliability and potential for clinical application. However, few studies have investigated the validity and reliability of the Kinect 2 for upper extremitymotion. This investigation compared reliability and validity among the Kinect 1, Kinect 2 and a videomotion capture (VMC) system for upper extremity movements. Results indicated good reliability for both Kinects within a day; results between days were inconclusive for both devices due to the inability to exactly repeat the desired movements. Range of motion (ROM) magnitudes for both Kinects were different from the VMC, yet patterns of motion were very highly correlated for both devices. Simple transformations of Kinect data could bring magnitudes in line with those of the VMC,allowing the Kinects to be used in a clinical setting.The Kinect 2 provides a more cost effective option compared to the VMC. Additionally, the Kinect is more portable, requires less time to set-up, and takes up less space, thus increasing its overall usability compared to the VMC.
