Taught (2) courses for first-year students in the College of Engineering. I led students through projects that applied Arduinos, basic instrumentation, and MATLAB programming towards solving real-life problems. In addition to building foundations for pursuing a career in engineering, this class was meant to inspire students to continue their studies into a specific engineering discipline. I shared my personal experiences as an engineer to help inspire students.
